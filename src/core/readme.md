# Core

These files make up the game "engine". They are a collection of useful patterns that I have developed over many years and many games. I tend to just copy/paste this folder from project to project as I go, rather than actually publishing this as a library because I tend to make lots of upgrades to it,
but sometimes I also make some game-specific changes to it.
